## Overview

  - Frontend Mentor | Profile card component coding challenge
  - The challenge consisted in replicating an Profile card component for a desktop and mobile view perspective.
  - Here it is a screenshot taken from desktop perspective;

- My process
  - Built with: HTML + CSS
  - This was a challenging one to copy the design, specially the background part. It took me a while to figure out how to implement the background with the two given images. I had to use background-image property in the body part and adjust both images at the same time to make it work. This was the most difficult part and the rest was kind easy to custom.
